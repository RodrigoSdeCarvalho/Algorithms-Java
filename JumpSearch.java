// Jump Search Algorithm is a relatively new algorithm for searching an element in a sorted array.

// The fundamental idea behind this searching technique is to search fewer number of elements compared to linear search algorithm 
// (which scans every element in the array to check if it matches with the element being searched or not). 
// This can be done by skipping some fixed number of array elements or jumping ahead by fixed number of steps in every iteration.

//The time complexity of the jump search algorithm is O(âˆšn).
